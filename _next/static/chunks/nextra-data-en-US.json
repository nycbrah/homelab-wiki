This setup often includes servers, networking gear, storage devices, and virtualization platforms.","reasons-to-build#Reasons to build":"Here are some of the reasons to build a Homelab:\nLearning IT and networking skills that can get you the skills needed for a job. Jobs such as a system administrator, a devops engineer, a site reliability engineer, and so forth.\nLearning IT and networking skills for fun\nTinkering around with self-hosted applications outside of a work environment to build out quick POCs (proof of concepts)\nAdvanced home automation\nHosting a media server\nStoring your data privately instead of on the cloud\nYou can find a more extensive list on this reddit homelab wiki section.","limitations#Limitations":"","time#Time":"The amount of time you can invest in building a Homelab is probably the biggest limitation. You're going to research topics heavily, debug issues frequently, and also spend time maintaining and upgrading the Homelab as you go.","money#Money":"A Homelab is not cheap, here are some of the costs to consider:\nHardware (servers, networking equipment, storage devices, etc.): This includes the initial investment in physical equipment like servers, switches, routers, and any other hardware components needed for your Homelab setup. This will be your biggest expense, be cautionary and buy what you can afford.\nDomain registration: if you want to access your homelab using a custom domain name (e.g., myhomelab.com) instead of IP addresses, you'll need to register and renew the domain, which incurs an annual fee.\nPower consumption: Running servers, networking gear, and other equipment can contribute to increased electricity usage, leading to higher electricity bills. The older servers with older gen CPUs may be cheaper to buy, but also come at a higher electricity bill.\nBackup and disaster recovery solutions: If you care if your data in your Homelab is lost, you'll need to implement a backup solution. There are a few outlined here. TODO: add link to backup strategies\nSubscriptions:  You may need licenses or subscriptions for applications, security software, or productivity tools used within your homelab environment. For example, if you are interested in hosting a media server, one of the pathways to fetch that media is a Usenet client(TODO: link usenet clients) involves paying for subscriptions.\nSecurity tools: If you want to enhance your security, i.e. such as adding a VPN service for your Homelab, that will incur additional costs.","hardware#Hardware":"This ties into money, but how powerful a CPU is will matter for CPU intensive tasks or running multiple tasks in parallel. The amount of RAM you have will heavily dictate how many apps you can run in your hardware. For running tasks such as larger LLMs, you may need a GPU."}},"/guides/hardware_guide":{"title":"Hardware Guide","data":{"":"This is the guide for all Hardware related information."}},"/planning/hardware_selection":{"title":"Hardware Selection","data":{"hardware-selection#Hardware Selection":"Buy what you can afford, or use what you already have. An old laptop lying around? Using an old laptop or any spare hardware can be a cost-effective way to dive into homelab projects. Below are some options if you do decide to buy some hardware.\nPersonally, I went the Mini PCs route since I felt they were the best bang for your buck and I wanted a fleet of them (3 or more).","comparison#Comparison":"Aspect\tMini PCs\tRaspberry Pi\tServers\tCost\t‚úÖ Affordable\t‚úÖ Very Affordable\tHigher\tPower Consumption\t‚úÖ Low to High\t‚úÖ Low\tHigh\tComputing Power\t‚úÖ Medium-High\tLimited\t‚úÖ High\tSize\t‚úÖ Small\t‚úÖ Tiny\tBig\tNoise\t‚úÖ Quiet-Some noise\t‚úÖ Quiet\tLoud\tCustomization\tLimited\tLimited\t‚úÖ  Highly Customizable\tCommunity Support\tLess\t‚úÖ Extensive\t‚úÖ Good\tOperating System Support\t‚úÖ Full-fledged OS (Windows, Linux, macOS)\tLinux-based (Raspbian, others), limited Windows support\t‚úÖ Full range of OS options"}},"/":{"title":"Welcome üëã","data":{"":"Welcome to my Homelab Wiki, a project born out of the need for cohesion and organization in my journey of building and managing a Homelab.
