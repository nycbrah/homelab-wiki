# Welcome ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my Homelab Wiki! This is my personal resource for understanding key concepts and documenting everything from what a homelab is to how to configure various components.

## Intended Audience

This Homelab wiki is designed to be used for myself and is open to other individuals passionate about building a Homelab with automation at its core. If you envision your Homelab as cattleâ€”resources that can be swiftly provisioned, scaled, and decommissioned as neededâ€”then you're in the right place.
